Now, here's how to set up `django-virtual-models` for local development.

1. Fork the `django-virtual-models` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/django-virtual-models.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed,
this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv django-virtual-models
    $ cd django-virtual-models/

4. Install the project and the dev requirements::

    $ pip install -e ".[doc,dev,test]"

5. Install pre-commit checks::

    $ pre-commit install

6. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

7. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass tests,
including testing other Python and Django versions with tox::

    $ pytest
    $ pytest example
    $ tox

8. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

9. Submit a Pull Request through the GitHub website.

-----------------------

Before you submit a Pull Request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The Pull Request should include tests.
2. If the Pull Request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
3. The CI should pass.
